### Abstract
This  paper  develops  a  method  for  the  exact  simulation  of  a  skeleton,  a  hitting  time,  and  other  functionals  of  a  one-dimensional  jump  diffusion  with  state-dependent  drift,  volatility,  jump  intensity,  and  jump  size.  The  method  requires  the drift function to be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^1" title="C^1" />, the volatility function to be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^2" title="C^2" />, and the jump intensity function to be locally bounded. No further structure is imposed on these functions. The method leads to unbiased simulation estimators of security prices, transition densities, hitting probabilities, and other quantities. Numerical results illustrate its features.
